# ClientChatServer

See the demo here: https://www.loom.com/share/4a4b4792127749e680945b8c9c7f9c36

This project creates a chat client that is able to communicate with a server. The client will send messages to the server, which can then broadcast the message to all the other clients on the system. Similarly, the client will be able to receive messages directly from the server, thus enabling the user to read messages sent by all other clients on the system.

Since this is a class project, I cannot publish the code here. Please get in touch with me at phamngoctramnguyen@gmail.com if you want to see the code/ want to chat :)
